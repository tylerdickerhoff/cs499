##PAC-MAN


### Overview

The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pellets. When all pellets are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage.  Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost and the Pac-Man itself withers and dies. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Pac-Man is awarded a bonus life at 10,000 points by default.

Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses. In later stages, the enemies go straight to flashing, bypassing blue, which means that they can only be eaten for a short amount of time, although they still reverse direction when a power pellet is eaten; in even later stages, the ghosts do not become edible, but they still reverse direction.

The enemies in Pac-Man are known as "ghosts", Despite the seemingly random nature of the enemies, their movements are strictly deterministic, which players have used to their advantage, each enemy with its own distinct personality in order to keep the game from becoming impossibly difficult or boring to play.  The red enemy chases Pac-Man, and the pink and blue enemies try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, the orange enemy's behavior is random.

### Minimum Regquirements  
player controlled pacman
pacman eats pellets
ghost track pacman
ghost collision 
lives
score

## Getting Started

Main window:
	appear after program lost
	contain a window and a playing field
	Reset
	Clear high score
	Exit

Title Screen:
	Auto displayed
	Name, logo, instructions on how to start/operate game

Rendering:
	Maze
		atleast 4 vertical and 4 horizontal lanes
	Atleast 2 ghosts
	Pac-dots
	Walls (that define the passages)
	
Text displayed:
	Current score
	Current high score
		both at top
	Lower corner -> number of lives

Control:
	Keyboard controlled
	Move according to arrows, speed constant
	Move w/o changing directions if no key pushed, stops if hits walls

Movement:
	All characters move along lanes, but can't go into unreachable areas
	When pacman passes a pac-dot or power pellet, the dot disappears

Animations:
	jaws open and close for pacman
	include some animation for ghosts
	some form of dieing animation for pacman
	

Ghost behavior (minimum):
	keep moving in same direction until they reach a crossing..
	then pick a random direction and repeat

Game over:
	1. when all pac-dots are eaten -> display a "congratulations" screen
	2. if all lives lost -> game over screen
	3. Press any key to remove these screens, return to title screen

Bonus features:
	*clearly declare in documentation*
	use of sound
	power pellet
	ghost box
	teleport tunnel (side to side and up to down)
	demo-mode (if title screen is displayed and no action performed)
	



Grading:
	- program = 65 %
	- documentation = 20 %
		UML diagrams
		explain classes and objects
		focus on inheritance and polymorphism if used
		data structures to store things like pac-dots and maze
		explain implementation for animations etc..
		Include a Readme
	- code = 15 %
		uniform formatting
		classes and objects etc named properly
		explanatory comments throughout
